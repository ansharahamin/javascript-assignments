# 📚 JavaScript Assignments

This repository contains my JavaScript assignments, practice exercises, and small projects.  
The aim is to learn and practice **JavaScript basics** step-by-step, including arrays, loops, conditionals, and DOM manipulation.

## 📁 Contents
Each assignment is organized in separate files, covering topics such as:

- **Variables & Data Types**
- **Operators & Expressions**
- **Conditional Statements (`if`, `else if`, `switch`)**
- **Loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`)**
- **Arrays & Array Methods**  
  - `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`, `sort()`, `join()`
- **Functions**
- **Events & DOM Manipulation**
- **Small Practice Programs**
